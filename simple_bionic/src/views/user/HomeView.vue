            These are less formulations of a position than fragmentary and largely
programmatic aspects of Zarathustra’s self-diagnosis and the cure he at
least aspires to. Many philosophical questions arise inevitably.Whatwould
be amiss, lost, wrong in a life not fully or not at all “led” by a subject?
How could this aspiration towards something believed to be higher or
more worthy than what one is or has now be directed, if all the old language
of external or objective forms of normative authority is now impossible?
On what grounds can one say that a desire to cultivate a different sort of
self, to overcome oneself, is really in the service of a “higher” self? Higher
in what sense? What could be said to be responsible for (relied on for)
securing this obedience, for helping to ward off skepticism when it arises?
Under what conditions can such commitments and projects be said to
lose their grip on a subject, fail, or die?
In general Zarathustra does not fully accept the burden of these questions as ones he must assume. For one thing he clearly does not believe
that the inspiration for such an attempt at self-direction and something
like “becoming better at becoming who one is” can be provided by an
argument or a revelation or a command. One would already have had to
measure oneself and one’s worth against “arguments” or “revelation” or
“authoritative commands” for such different calls to be effective and it
is to that prior, deepest level of commitment that Zarathustra, however
indirectly and figuratively, is directing his rhetoric. And given the great
indeterminateness of his approach, he is clearly much more interested
in the qualitative characteristics of such commitments than with their
content. The quality he is most interested in turns out to be extremely
complex: on the one hand, “whole-heartedness” and an absorbed or passionate “identification” with one’s higher ideal; on the other hand, a
paradoxical capacity to “let go” of such commitments and pursue other
ideals when the originals (somehow) cease to serve self-overcoming and
self-transcendence, when they lead to complacency and contentment.
However, to come to by far the most complicated issue introduced
by Zarathustra’s speeches, he clearly also thinks that such qualitative
considerations – the chief topic of the book, the qualitative dimensions
